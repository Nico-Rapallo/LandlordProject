0,5/9/2025,Gary shelly,1.0,Gary acts like he is a nice caring man but in fact does not treat his properties well and always takes the cheap way out. He either will refuse to get a professional service to come fix things or will replace broke appliances with pre used ones from other properties. He is a scam artist through and through. ,"4,500-5,500",None,Yes,2.0,"500 - 1,000","The house was big and had the potential to be great but there were rats running around, mold in the bathrooms, leaks everywhere. It was disgusting and not well kept no matter how hard we cleaned etc. ",2146

We do not interact with the owner so I can not speak to them, but the house is in really poor shape. Everything just feels crumby in general. There is no insulation and the heaters in the house is not even close to sufficient enough to keep the house warm in the winter. There is also no air circulation. In addition to rats, we have roaches and ants. ",2149

7,4/29/2025,Tom and Jan Barry,1.0,"Despite a written rule in our housing contract explaining that they must give us tenants a notice that they will be coming by our house, these two have on multiple occasions shown up at our house unannounced and entering without permission. Rent is already high enough and after fixing a faulty heating component (their actual job) Tom and Jan have decided to raise the cost of rent a combined $400 each month for our next year of leasing. They have on multiple occasions removed personal property from the house and garage without consulting with us tenants that these expensive items may be actually used by someone. Otherwise they pile up their junk furniture in the basement and garage which we cannot access. ","3,500 - 4,500",Some,Yes,4.0,"500 - 1,000",,1119

18,5/10/2025,Gary Shelly,1.0,"I hate Gary Shelly with all of my heart and soul. One time we smelled natural gas in the kitchen of our house and he came, got on his hands and knees and sniffed the oven and said “‘no problems here.” We called the gas company that day and they said there was a gas leak. Basically the house could have exploded. Then Gary came and swapped out our gas oven for an electric oven. This project took two months and during that time he left one oven in the kitchen while installing the electric oven which is completely illegal without an electricians license. 

During the city inspector visit who I guess he is friends with, he walked the guy around the house and when the inspector pointed out the problem he just said “oh I’ll fix that.”

Another time water poured from our ceiling into the foyer and he told us these water leaks came from someone showering and getting too much water on the floor.

The city tried to evict us at one point and when we asked him if he was going to charge us rent if we got evicted he tried to convince us this was a political issue and we needed to mobilize the student body to vote in a new council. 

It is beyond me how this man still had a rental license. I would love to know who he is paying. ","4,500-5,500",None,Yes,3.0,"500 - 1,000",This house is a 100 year old piece of shit. ,1159
19,5/8/2025,Angela Bailey,1.0,"She is extremely unreasonable and has actively tried to make the housing experience worse for me and other tenants (seemingly). She will take her time to respond and fix issues at our house that we notify her of through work orders, but whenever she deems there is an issue (examples: she threatened to evict us over having cars parked on the grass next to our driveway and another time for having 2 bikes sitting next to bushes in the front yard) or we have a party she is quick to pay a visit and ruin our days. We are less afraid of noise complaints than our landlord atp 😭","> 5,500",None,Yes,5.0,"500 - 1,000","treehouse is amazing, we havent had any issues other than our unfortunate landlord experience.
