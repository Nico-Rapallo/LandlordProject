Rent is already high enough and after fixing a faulty heating component (their actual job) Tom and Jan have decided to raise the cost of rent a combined $400 each month for our next year of leasing. They have on multiple occasions removed personal property from the house and garage without consulting with us tenants that these expensive items may be actually used by someone.

However, the landlord has been somewhat hard to get a hold of, delayed sending back the lease signed by the landlord DESPITE rushing us to get in a lease signed by us. Have heard mixed things from people in other properties managed by this company / person, especially in delay of things getting repaired or replaced, but nothing terrible, always seems to get fixed even if a few weeks late.

5/10/2025 1:39:54,Gary Shelly,1,"I hate Gary Shelly with all of my heart and soul. One time we smelled natural gas in the kitchen of our house and he came, got on his hands and knees and sniffed the oven and said “‘no problems here.” We called the gas company that day and they said there was a gas leak. Basically the house could have exploded. Then Gary came and swapped out our gas oven for an electric oven. This project took two months and during that time he left one oven in the kitchen while installing the electric oven which is completely illegal without an electricians license. 

During the city inspector visit who I guess he is friends with, he walked the guy around the house and when the inspector pointed out the problem he just said “oh I’ll fix that.”

Another time water poured from our ceiling into the foyer and he told us these water leaks came from someone showering and getting too much water on the floor.

The city tried to evict us at one point and when we asked him if he was going to charge us rent if we got evicted he tried to convince us this was a political issue and we needed to mobilize the student body to vote in a new council. 

It is beyond me how this man still had a rental license. I would love to know who he is paying. ",I don’t currently live in 711 Richmond road but I did a year ago. ,"4,500-5,500",No utilities included,Yes,3,"500 - 1,000",This house is a 100 year old piece of shit.
